#MandelbrotViewerQt   
   
##Mandelbrot viewer with a minimalist UI and controls.  
###Implemented as a Qt QWidget so you can include it in your own projects.   
 - Left and right arrow keys are intercepted and connected to the color shift slots
 - Left mouse click events zoom the Mandelbrot renderer in, decreasing the grid delta of each pixel on the complex plane.
 - Right mouse click events do the same, except zooming out and increasing the grid delta of each pixel
